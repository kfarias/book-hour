## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - What tools did you use to implement this project?

#### Example:  

This was a two week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included getting familiar with Redux and looking up documentation while working on my own.

I originally set out to build an MVP that allowed people to look over the books of specific genres and save favorites. I did not meet this goal. The favorites functionality was not met. One of the things I wish I would have focused on was fetching just one API and building that out all the way through instead of tackling all of the different genres. i will still add favorites and work on adding users and geolocation as a personal goal.

This project was challenging because I didn't have a good handle on `Redux` when I started, but it was a learning goal I had.
